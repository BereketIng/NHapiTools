1. Release notes NHapiTools
The NHapiTools are tools that will make using NHapi (the open source .Net HL7 implementation) easier. NHapi has a steep learning 
curve and not everything works as easy as it should. NHapiTools aims to improve that without tampering with NHapi itselves.

2. Functionality
- Source generation that will generate extension methods on NHapi assemblies. (some generated assemblies are provided)
- Generic extention methods.
- Easy IO tools for reading multiple files, implementing MLLP and filtering Base64 data reducing memory use and increasing speed.
- Tools to generate ACK messages based on any message
- Tools to implement custom (standard) segments (which is not possible with NHapi)
- Default validation rules to be used by the NHapi parser
- Two sets of context implementation to easily add all or configurable validation rules.

3. Changelog
- V1.7 Release (March 2017)
  Updated nHapi to v2.5.0.6
  Added extension models for HL7 v26, v27, v271, v28, v281

- V1.6 Release (April 2015)
  Updated to work with NuGet. Updated to the latest version of NHapi and fixed some bugs.
  
- V1.5 Release (April 2015)
  Fixed bug in ERR segment. Added custom ACK message classes for HL7 V2.2 and V2.1 since these seem to be missing from NHapi.

- V1.4 Release (December 2014)
  Added more HL7 versions. Finished documentation.

- V1.3 Release (September 2014)
  Fixed bug in ACK message generation for HL7 V2.3.1 messages.

- V1.2 Release (March 2014)
  Added a Simple MLLP Client class for easy client server communication. The class supports plain TCP/IP as wel as SSL (including 
  authentication through a client certificate). Cleaned up compiler warnings (including generated code) and changed the output
  directory in code generation from "Messages" to "Message", which is in line with the namespace.

- V1.1 Release (March 2014)
  Added stream to filter Base64 data from HL7 messages. This improves performance while parsing messages with NHapi, especially 
  if messages contain large chunks of data.

- V1.0 Release (Januari 2014)
  First release of the NHapiTools. Containing source generation, generated extention methods for V2.3, V2.3.1, V2.4 and V2.5, 
  MultipleFileStream, HL7MessageEnumerators, MLLP, ACK tools, support for validation rules using automated and configurable contexts and
  standard segment override using EhancedModelClassFactory and the GenericMessageWrapper. Including test/example project.
